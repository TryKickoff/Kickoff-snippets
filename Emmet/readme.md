# Emmet snippets

If you have the brilliant [Emmet](http://emmet.io) plugin installed, you can use these snippets instead of the other snippets provided.

### Setup

#### 1.
Create `Emmet.sublime-settings` in your `User` directory if you haven't already. Then add the following to the file and change the directory to your Sublime user folder.

```json
{
	"extensions_path" : "~/path/to/your/sublime/user/folder/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Emmet"
}
```

#### 2.
Create an `Emmet` folder in your user directory and copy the `snippets-kickoff.json` into it.

See my own settings for example: https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeText3UserSettings/tree/master/
